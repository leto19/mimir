      "Anna Karenina\n",
      "Anna Karenina is the tragic story of a married aristocrat/socialite and her affair with the affluent Count Vronsky . The story opens when she arrives in the midst of a family broken up by her brother s unbridled womanizing—something that prefigures her own later situation , though she would experience less tolerance by others . A bachelor , Vronsky is eager to marry her if she will agree to leave her husband Karenin , a senior government official , but she is vulnerable to the pressures of Russian social norms , the moral laws of the Russian Orthodox Church , her own insecurities , and Karenin s indecision . Although Vronsky and Anna go to Italy , where they can be together , they have trouble making friends . Back in Russia , she is shunned , becoming further isolated and anxious , while Vronsky pursues his social life . Despite Vronsky s reassurances , she grows increasingly possessive and paranoid about his imagined infidelity , fearing loss of control . A parallel story within the novel is that of Konstantin Levin , a wealthy country landowner who wants to marry Princess Kitty , sister to Dolly and sister-in-law to Anna s brother Oblonsky . Konstantin has to propose twice before Kitty accepts . The novel details Konstantin s difficulties managing his estate , his eventual marriage , and his personal issues , until the birth of his first child . The novel explores a diverse range of topics throughout its approximately thousand pages . Some of these topics include an evaluation of the feudal system that existed in Russia at the time—politics , not only in the Russian government but also at the level of the individual characters and families , religion , morality , gender and social class.The novel is divided into eight parts . Its epigraph is Vengeance is mine , I will repay , from Romans 12:19 , which in turn quotes from Deuteronomy 32:35 . The novel begins with one of its most often-quoted lines : Happy families are all alike ; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\n",
