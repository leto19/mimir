[Transcriber's note: Until recently this work was attributed to John Lydgate, but now most scholars consider that the author is unknown.
The first mention of Lydgate's authorship of this work was made by Stephen Hawes in 1505 as one of Lydgate's seven major works.
But many scholars have doubted over the years that this poem was written by Lydgate, because the style used doesn't greatly resemble the style of Lydgate's other works, and the vocabulary is somewhat more modern than Lydgate is known to have used.
Modern scholars believe that this work was written between 1478 and 1483 (about forty years after Lydgate's death).
Analysis of style and vocabulary have led scholars to conclude that the author might have been a woman.
For further information about this poem please see The Assembly of Gods, edited by Jane Chance, published by Medieval Institute Publications, Kalamazoo, Michigan, 1999, ISBN: 1580440223, which is also available online at http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/asint.htm.
The book from which this e-book was transcribed is a fascimile reprint of the third printing of this book, made by Wynkyn de Worde circa 1500.
The book was printed in blackletter font known as Wynkyn de Worde's type 3, and uses many abbreviations, which I have expanded and rendered inside parenthesis, eg.
, {x}.
The abbreviations used in this book are:
*Macron over the letter.
The most common one, usually meaning
missing "n" or "m" after the letter.
But in some cases might also
mean missing "e," "er" or "re" after the letter.
This happens
usually when p, q or r have macrons.
*Little e over Middle-English thorn, meaning "the."
*Little t over Middle-English thorn, meaning "that."
*Little u over Middle-English thorn, meaning "thou."
*Little t over w, meaning "with."
*Middle-English yogh, representing "gh."
*Superscripted 9 after letter, meaning missing "us." Used only at
the end of the word.
*Superscripted 2 after letter, meaning missing "e," "er" or "re."
Used only at the end of the word.
*Stretched s, looking like integral sign, meaning missing "e" or "i"
before letter s.
*Dot over the letter, meaning missing "e," "er" or "re" after the
letter.
Usually used with d, t, e and u.
Combination q+d with dot
means "quod."
*Strike through letter, meaning missing "e," "er" or "re" after the
letter.
Usually used with p, v and s.
Striked through p might also
mean missing "ro" or "or" after p.
Occasionally there were some letters printed upside down.
I have rendered them inside brackets, e.g., [x].
The poem uses two types of punctuation--a dot, meaning longer pause, and a slash, meaning shorter pause or comma.
I have corrected many errors and noted them on a right margin.
Also this printing was missing three lines and one line had several letters missing from the middle of the line.
I have marked them on a right margin and the correct reading supplied from the modern edition.
There were a couple of places where the word "nota" or "note" was printed, but the actual notes weren't found in this reprint.
There's a fair chance that those notes were never printed.

The assemble of goddes by John Lydgate
Printed at Westminster by Wynkyn de Worde about the year 1500
Cambridge at the University Press 1906
The work here reprinted formed part of the famous volume of black-letter tracts (formerly marked AB.
4.
58), which came to the University Library in 1715 by the gift of King George the First with the rest of the library of John Moore, Bishop of Ely.
No other copy of this edition is recorded to be in existence.
The types used are Caxton's type 3 (for the title) and Wynkyn de Worde's type 3, with final m and n etc.
from type 1 (in the rest of the book).
This type 3 is not known to have been used before 1499.
Mr Sayle remarks that the woodcut illustration is taken from Caxton's second edition (ab.
1483-4) of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.

¶ To vycyous people is the verey scourge smert  and Predestinacion
¶ Rewarde for they fro Vertue wolde peruert
¶ And endelesse Ioye is to hem that be electe
¶ Rewarded & to all that folow the same secte
¶ And as for the keyes of the posternes fyue
Whiche were to Morple{us} rewarded for his laboure
¶ Sygnyfye not elles but whyle man is on lyue
¶ His fyue inwarde wyttes shall be euery hour
¶ In his slepe occupyed in hele & in langour
¶ With fantasyes tryfels Illusyons & dremes
¶ Whiche Poetes call Morpleus stremes
¶ And as for Residiuacyon is nomore to say
¶ But after Confessyon tornyng ayene to synne
¶ Whiche to euery man retornyth sauns delay
¶ To vycyous lyuyng agayn hym to wynne
¶ Whyle ony man lyueth wyll it neuer blynne
¶ That cursed conclusyon for to bryng aboute
¶ But Reason with Sadnes kepe it styll oute
¶ Here hast thou properly the verrey sentence
¶ Perde now declared of this vysyon
¶ The pycture also yeueth clere intellygence
¶ Therof beholden with good dyscresyon
¶ Loke well aboute and take consyderasyon
¶ As I haue declared whether hit soo be
¶ A syr quoth Morpleus what tolde I the
¶ Hast thou properly the verey sentence
¶ Loke on yon wall yonder before
¶ And all that tyme stood I in a wyre
¶ Whiche way first myn hert wolde yeue more
¶ To loke in a stody stood I therfore
¶ Neuerthelesse at last as Morpleus me badde
¶ I loked forwarde with contenaunce sadde
¶ Where I beheld in portrayture
¶ The maner of the felde euen as it was
Shewed me before & euery creature
¶ On bothe sydes beyng drawyng in small space
¶ Soo caryously in soo lytyll a compace
¶ In all this worlde was neuer thyng wrought
¶ Hit were Impossyble in erthe to be thought
¶ And when I had long beholde that pycture
¶ What q{uo}d Morpleus how longe shalte thou loke
¶ Daryng as a dastard on yon portrayture:
¶ Come of for shame thy wytte stante a croke
¶ I heryng that myn herte to me toke
¶ Towarde the fourthe wall tornyng my vysage
¶ Where I sawe Poetes & Phylosophers sage
¶ Many one moo that at the banket
¶ Serued the goddes as I sayde before
¶ Som were made standyng & som in chayris set
¶ Som lokyng on bokys as they had stodyed sore
¶ Som drawyng almenakis & in her hondis bore
¶ Astyrlabes takyng the altytude of the sonne
¶ Among whome Dyogenes sate in a tonne
¶ And as I was lokyng on that fourthe wall
¶ Of Dyogenes beholdyng the ymage
¶ Sodeynly Doctryne began me to call
¶ And bad me tourne towarde hyr my vysage
¶ And soo then I dyde with humble corage
¶ Whan thynkest {thou} she sayd hast {thou} not thentent
¶ Yet of these foure walles what they represent
¶ The pycture on the fyrst {that} standeth at my bake
¶ Sheweth the {the} present tyme of pylgremage
¶ Of whiche before I vnto the spake
¶ Whiche is the tyme of daungerous passage
¶ The seconde dyscrettly agayne my vysage
¶ The tyme expresseth of Deuyacyon
¶ Whyle paynyme lawe had the domynacyon
¶ The thryd wall standyng on my lyfe honde
¶ The tyme representeth of Reuocacyon
¶ And the fourthe standyng on my ryght honde
¶ Determyneth the tyme of Reconsylyacyon
¶ This is the effecte of thy vysyon
¶ Wherfore the nedeth no more theron to muse
¶ Hit were but veyne thy wyttes to dysuse
¶ But duryng the tym of Reconsylyacyon
¶ Thy tyme of pylgremage loke well {thou} spende
¶ And then woll gracyous Predestynacyon                 Original has
¶ Bryng the to glory at thy law ende                    well instead
¶ And euen with that came to my mynde                   of woll
¶ My fyrst conclusyon that I was aboute
¶ To haue dreuen er slepe made me to lute
¶ That is to say how Sensualyte
¶ {With} Reason to acorde myght be brought aboute
¶ Whiche caused me to knele downe on my kne
¶ And beseke Doctryne determyne that doute
¶ Oo Lord god sayd Doctry{n}e canst {thou} not withoute
¶ Me that conclusyon bryng to an ende
¶ Ferre is fro the wytte & ferther good mende
¶ And euen with that Dethe gan appere
¶ Shewyng hymselfe as though that he wolde
¶ His darte haue occupyed within that herbere
¶ But there was none for hym yong nor olde
¶ Saue oonly I Doctrine hym tolde
¶ And when I herde hyr with hym comon thus
¶ I me withdrew behynde Morpleus.
¶ Dredyng full sore lest he with his dart.
¶ Through Doctrynes wordes ony entresse.
¶ In me wolde haue had or claymed ony part
¶ Which sholde haue caused me grete heuynesse
¶ Within whiche tyme & short processe
¶ Came thyder Reason and Sensualyte.
¶ A quoth Doctryne ryght welcome be ye
¶ Hit is not long sythe we of you spake
¶ Ye must er ye goo determyne a doute
¶ And euen with that she the mater brake
¶ To theym & tolde hit euery where aboute
¶ I wolde haue be thens yf I had moute
¶ For fere I loked as blake as a cole
¶ I wolde haue cropen in a mouse hole
¶ What quoth Doctryne where is he now
¶ That meu[i]d this mater straunge & dyffuse
¶ He is a cowarde I make myn auow
¶ He hyded his hede his mocyon to refuse
¶ Blame hym not q{uo}d Reason alway {that} to vse
¶ When he seeth Dethe soo nere at his honde
¶ Yet is his part hym to withstonde
¶ Or at the leste way elles fro hym flee                Original has
¶ As longe as he may who dooth other wyse               fym instead
¶ Is an ydeote quoth Sensualytee                        of hym
¶ Who dredeth not Dethe wyse men hym dyspyse
¶ What said Doctryne how long hathe this gyse
¶ Be holden & vsed thus atwixe you tweyne
¶ Ye were not wonte to acorde certeyne
¶ Yes quoth Reason in this poynt alway
¶ To euery man haue we yeuen our counsayll
¶ Dethe for to flee as long as they may
¶ Although wo otherwyse haue done our trauayl
¶ Eche other to represse yet withoute fayll
¶ In that poynt oonly dyscordeth we neuer
¶ Thus condescended therin be we for euer
¶ Aha sayd Doctryne then is the conclusyon
¶ Clerely determined of the gret doute
¶ That here wes meuyd & halfe in derysyon
¶ She me then called & bade me loke oute
¶ Come forthe she sayd & feere not this route
¶ And euen with that Reason & Sensualyte
¶ And Dethe fro thens were vanysshed all thre
¶ Then loked I forthe as Doctryne me badde
¶ When Dethe was gone me thought I was bolde
¶ To shewe myselfe but yet was I sadde
¶ Me thought my doute was not as I wolde
¶ Clerely and openly declared & tolde
¶ Hit sowned to me as a parable
¶ Derke as a myste or a fayned fable                    Original has
myhe instead
¶ And Doctryne my conceyte gan espy                     of myste
¶ Wherfore sayd she standest thou soo styll
¶ Wherin is thy thought arte thou in stody
¶ Of thy questyon hast thou not thy fyll
¶ To the declared tell me thy wyll.
¶ Herdest thou not Reason & Sensualyte
¶ Declared thy doute here before the
¶ Forsothe quoth I I herde what they sayde
¶ But neuerthelesse my wytte is so thynne
¶ And also of Dethe I was so afrayde
¶ That hit is out where hit vent ynne
¶ And so that mater can I not wynne
¶ Without your helpe & benyuolence
¶ Therof to expresse the veray sentence
¶ Well quod Doctryne then yeue attendaunce
¶ Vnto my wordes & thou shalt here
¶ Openly declared the concordaunce
¶ Atwene Sensualyte & Reason in fere
¶ If thou take hede hit clerely dooth apere
¶ How they were knette in one opynyon
¶ Bothe agayn Dethe helde contradyccon
¶ Whiche concordaunce no more sygnyfyeth
¶ To playne vnderstandyng but in euery mane
¶ Bothe Sensualyte & Reason applyeth
¶ Rather Dethe to flee then with hir to be tane
¶ Loo in that poynt accorde they holly thane
¶ And in all other they clerely dyscorde
¶ Thus is trewly set thy doubtfull monacorde
¶ I heryng that kneled on my kne
¶ And thanked her lowly for her dyscyplyne
¶ That she wouchesafe of her benygnyte
¶ Of tho gret doubtes me to enlumyne
¶ Well was she worthy to be called Doctryne
¶ If it had be no more but for the solucyon
¶ Of my demaunde & of this straunge vysyon
¶ And as I with myne hede began for to bow
¶ As me well ought to do her reuerence
¶ She thens departed I can not tell how
¶ But within a moment gone was she thens
¶ Then sayd Morpleus let vs go hens
¶ what sholde we here tarye lengere
¶ Hast thou not herde a generall answere
¶ To all thy materes that thou lyst to meue
¶ My tyme draweth nere that I must rest
¶ And euen therewith he toke me by the sleue
¶ And sayd goo we hens for that sholde I best
¶ As good is ynough as a grete fest
¶ Thou hast seen ynough holde the content
¶ And euen with {that} forthe with hym I went
¶ Tyll he had me brought agene to my bedde
¶ where he me founde and then pryuely                   Original has
¶ He stale awaye I coude not vnderstande                pruyely
¶ were he became but sodeynly                           instead of
¶ As he came he went I tell you veryly                  pryuely
¶ whiche done fro slepe I gan to awake
¶ My body all in swet began for to shake
¶ For drede of the syght that I had sene
¶ wenyng to me all had be trew
¶ Actuelly done where I had bene
¶ That batyll holde twene Vyce & Vertew
¶ But when I see hit hit was but a whew
¶ A dreme a fantasy & a thyng of nought
¶ To study thereon I had nomore thought
¶ Tyll at the last I gan me bethynke
¶ For what cause shewed was this vysyon
¶ I knew not wherefore I toke pen & ynke
¶ And paper therof to make mencyon
¶ In wrytyng takyng consyderacyon
¶ That noo defaute were found in me

¶ Try out the corne clene from the chaff
And then may ye say ye have a sure staff
¶ To stande by at nede of ye wyll it holde
¶ And walke by the way of Vertue
