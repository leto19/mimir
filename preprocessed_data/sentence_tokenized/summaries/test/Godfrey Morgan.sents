The narrative begins with the auction by the US Government of fictional Spencer Island, located 460 miles off the California coast (32°15′N 145°18′W).
The island is uninhabited and there are only two bidders, William W. Kolderup, a very wealthy San Franciscan, and his arch-rival J. R. Taskinar, a resident of Stockton, California.
Kolderup wins the auction, buying Spencer Island for four million dollars.
J. R. Taskinar mutters, "I will be avenged!" before retiring to his hotel.
Godfrey, an idle twenty-two-year-old, lives with Kolderup, his uncle, and Kolderup's adopted goddaughter, Phina, whom Godfrey has grown to love.
Prior to marrying Phina, Godfrey asks to undertake a world tour.
Acceding to his desire, his uncle sends Godfrey on a sea voyage around the world on board one of his steamships, the Dream, commanded by Captain Turcott.
Godfrey is accompanied by his mentor, teacher, and dance instructor, Professor T. Artelett aka "Tartlet".
After some time at sea, Godfrey is awakened one foggy night and told to abandon ship as the Dream is foundering.
After jumping into the sea, Godfrey is washed ashore on a deserted island, where he soon finds Tartlet has also been marooned.
Godfrey, with scant help from Tartlet, will have to learn to survive, to organize his life, face hostile intruders, and overcome other obstacles.
Eventually, they are also joined by Carefinotu, whom Godfrey rescues from Polynesians visiting the island.
By the end of the story the formerly jaded young man has discovered the value of independent effort, and he gains poise and courage.
The marooned group are rescued and returned to San Francisco, where Godfrey is reunited with Phina.
They agree to marry before continuing the world tour, this time together.
