The Eagle Cliff is a third-person tale that begins with the hero, a cyclist soon identified as John Barrett, who is racing through the streets of London to respond to a telegram from an old schoolmate, Bob Mabberly.
The unconventional hero has a literally bumpy start to his journey as he accidentally runs into a little old lady.
Though she appears to be alright, Barret's fear of being arrested causes him to flee.
However, because he is the hero, he cannot shake the guilty conscience and returns to the site of the accident, only to find that the old lady and the crowd that gathered to be gone.
Wrought with worry, Barret makes his way to Mabberly.
Mabberly has engaged a yacht and crew and intends to "sail, without fail" the next morning with Barrett and another schoolmate, Giles Jackman.
The next day, not long at sea, misfortune befalls the party and they collide with a passing steamer, causing their vessel to split down the middle.
Now in the water, the men make their way toward the rocky shore of a now-visible island.
Upon arrival, the men elect Barrett to search for habitation.
He comes across a sheep track, a primitive road and eventually a hut among the rocks.
From here, Barrett begins to meet the people who reside on the island, all of whom are white.
When the rest of the party joins Barrett, they are happy to learn the houses there are fully functioning (with kitchens and bedrooms, each stocked appropriately).
As fate would have it, Barrett happens upon a young girl, Milly, lying on the road, who has injured her arm after falling from a cliff.
Barret eventually develops feelings for her.
He and Milly share a love for botany, which was the cause of her fall from the cliff, and use this area of interest to pave the way for further interaction.
Elsewhere, the men engage in hunting outings as well as occasionally fishing (or in Archie's case, photography).
Meanwhile, Milly has been writing home, telling her mother about the man who saved her life, effectively causing her mother to become fond of him.
When news of Mrs. Moss' arrival reaches Barrett, he rushes to meet her, only to nearly knock her over.
She turns out to be the very same woman Barrett had hit with his bicycle earlier on.
At this point, though she recognizes him as the man who ran her down, she does not know he is Barret.
After falling from a cliff and falling unconscious, Barrett does not show up for supper, worrying the others and causing them to search for him.
Once found, he is unrecognizable due to the bruising and head-dressings he now bears, successfully continuing to hide his identity from Mrs. Moss.
Once he has healed and she discovers that he is indeed Barrett, she agrees to forgive him, thus allowing Milly and him to marry.
