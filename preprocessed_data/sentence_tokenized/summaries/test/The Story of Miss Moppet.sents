The tale opens with an illustration of a wide-eyed kitten: "This is a Pussy called Miss Moppet, she thinks she has heard a mouse!" The following illustration depicts a mouse wearing a pink bowtie and green jacket "peeping out behind the cupboard, and making fun of Miss Moppet. He is not afraid of a kitten." Miss Moppet darts at him, but misses and bumps her head on the cupboard.
She hits the cupboard very hard and rubs her nose.
The mouse scurries to the top of the cupboard and watches her.
Miss Moppet ties a duster about her head and sits before the fire on a red hassock.
The mouse's curiosity is piqued; he thinks she looks very ill and comes sliding down the bell-pull.
"Miss Moppet looks worse and worse." The mouse creeps nearer.
Miss Moppet holds her head in her paws and peeks at the mouse through a hole in the duster.
"The Mouse comes very close." Miss Moppet jumps and snags him by the tail.
"And because the Mouse has teased Miss MoppetâMiss Moppet thinks she will tease the Mouse; which is not at all nice of Miss Moppet." The kitten ties the mouse up in the duster then tosses it about like a ball.
The mouse peeks from the hole in the duster.
In the last illustration but one, Miss Moppet is seated upright on her rump and staring at the reader.
The duster lies opened and empty in her paws.
"She forgot about that hole in the duster", and the mouse has escaped.
He dances a jig safely out of Miss Moppet's reach atop the cupboard.
