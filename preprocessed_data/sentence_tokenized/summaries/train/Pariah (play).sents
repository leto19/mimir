The play involves a battle of brains between two men, âMr. X and Mr. Yââ in a Darwinian struggle for survival.
The men are in a room in a farmhouse during a storm.
A box of gold sits on the table, for which Mr. X is responsible.
Both have committed crimes in their personal history.
Mr. X, in his youth, murdered a man, but he was not caught, and he explains why it is right that he avoided punishment.
As for Mr. Y, he forged a financial document, which secured a loan.
For this he was caught and sent to prison, and he explains why it was unfair that he was punished.
As both stories are shared during the play, it sets the men against one another.
Which one is really the most guilty, and have either of them atoned for his sin?
Mr. Y finally rationalizes that Mr. X. should pay Mr. Y a penalty or a bribe as a way of bringing "a little better balance into these unequal human conditions." Or it can be seen as Mr. X paying a bribe to keep Mr. Y quiet about Mr. X's crime.
The atmosphere becomes tense and threatening, and the contest comes to a head when Y becomes armed with a knife, and X is armed with a stronger will, and can use his greater mental prowess to overpower Y.
