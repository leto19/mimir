Ellie Dunn, her father, and her fiancĂŠ are invited to one of Hesione Hushabyeâs infamous dinner parties, to be held at the house of her father, the eccentric Captain Shotover, an inventor in his late 80s who is trying to create a "psychic ray" that will destroy dynamite.
The house is built in the shape of the stern of a ship.
Lady Utterword, Shotover's other daughter, arrives from Australia, but he pretends not to recognise her.
Hesione says they are running out of money.
Shotover needs to invent a weapon of mass destruction.
His last invention, a lifeboat, did not bring in much cash.
Ellie intends to marry businessman Boss Mangan, but she really loves a man she met in the National Gallery.
Unfortunately, her fiancĂŠ is a ruthless scoundrel, her father's a bumbling prig, and it turns out that the man she's in love with is Hector, Hesione's husband, who spends his time telling romantic lies to women.
Marriage to Mangan will be the sensible choice.
A burglar is captured.
They say they do not want to prosecute him, but he insists he will turn himself in unless they pay him not to.
It turns out that the burglar is one of Shotover's old crewmen.
He confesses that he is not a real burglar.
He deliberately gets himself captured to get charitable assistance from his victims.
Shotover laments that the younger generation have lost their romance.
Ellie suggests that she should marry Shotover, but he says he's already married to a black Jamaican wife, though it's possible she's now dead.
Lady Utterword says that everything will be put to right if only they get some horses.
Every English family should have horses.
Mangan declares that he is to head a government department, but Ellie suddenly announces that she cannot marry him as she is now Shotover's "white wife".
Shotover predicts that the ship of England will founder, as the captain is drunk and the crew are all gambling.
The maid enters with news that an air-raid is about to happen.
The lights are switched off, but Hector switches them back on to demonstrate his lack of concern about the threat.
A bomb lands in the garden, blowing up Shotover's store of dynamite and killing Mangan and the burglar who were hiding there.
When it is over everyone says how bored they are.
They hope the bombs will come again tomorrow.
