The Revenge tells the story of Clermont D'Ambois, the brother of the dead Bussy.
Unlike the ruthless Bussy, Clermont is a Christian Stoic.
Clermont is a follower of the Duc de Guise, a powerful noblemanâthough this relationship breeds suspicion in the King, who is urged on by the political manipulator Baligny.
(Malicious characters in the play see Clermont's devotion to the Guise in homoerotic terms; but the stoical Clermont prefers relations with men over those with women, precisely because they are asexual.
) Eventually the Guise is assassinated, and Clermont commits suicide.
A subplot involves the relationship between Clermont and Tamyra, Bussy's former lover; Tamyra urges Clermont to take vengeance on her husband Montsurry, the agent of Bussy's destruction.
The cowardly Montsurry manages to avoid a confrontation with Clermont through most of the play; but in the final Act, Bussy's ghost rises to tell Clermont that divine justice demands the punishment of Montsurry.
Clermont finally persuades Montsurry to face him on the field of honor and accept his death.
The Stoic nature of the play extends beyond the values and worldview of the character Clermont.
In The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois, even more so than in other Chapman plays, events are reported rather than enacted, and little actually happens on stage.
This has prevented the play from earning itself a significant stage history.
