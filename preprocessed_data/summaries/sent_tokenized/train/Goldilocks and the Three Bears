In Southey's tale, three anthropomorphic bears – "a Little, Small, Wee Bear, a Middle-sized Bear, and a Great, Huge Bear" – live together in a house in the woods.
Southey describes them as very good-natured, trusting, harmless, tidy, and hospitable.
Each of these "bachelor" bears has his own porridge bowl, chair, and bed.
One day they take a walk in the woods while their porridge cools.
A woman approaches the bears' house.
As she has been sent out by her family, since she is a disgrace to them.
She is described at various points in the story as impudent, bad, foul-mouthed, ugly, dirty, and a vagrant deserving of a stint in the House of Correction.
She looks through a window, peeps through the keyhole, and lifts the latch.
Assured that no one is home, she walks in.
The old woman eats the Wee Bear's porridge, then settles into his chair and breaks it.
Prowling about, she finds the bears' beds and falls asleep in Wee Bear's bed.
The climax of the tale is reached when the bears return.
Wee Bear finds the old woman in his bed and cries, "Somebody has been lying in my bed, – and here she is!" The old woman starts up, jumps from the window, and runs away never to be seen again.
