The story focuses on a family of anthropomorphic rabbits.
The widowed mother rabbit cautions her young against entering the vegetable garden of a man named Mr McGregor, telling them: "your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs McGregor".
Her three daughters obediently refrain from entering the garden, going down the lane to pick blackberries, but her rebellious son Peter enters the garden to snack on some vegetables.
Peter ends up eating more than is good for him and goes looking for parsley to cure his stomach ache.
Peter is spotted by Mr McGregor and loses his jacket and shoes while trying to escape.
He hides in a watering can in a shed, but then has to run away again when Mr McGregor finds him, and ends up completely lost.
After sneaking past a cat, Peter sees the gate where he entered the garden from a distance and heads for it, despite being spotted and chased by Mr McGregor again.
With difficulty he wriggles under the gate, and escapes from the garden, but he spots his abandoned clothing being used to dress Mr McGregor's scarecrow.
After returning home, a sick Peter is sent to bed by his mother, while his well-behaved sisters receive a sumptuous dinner of milk and berries as opposed to Peter's supper of chamomile tea.
