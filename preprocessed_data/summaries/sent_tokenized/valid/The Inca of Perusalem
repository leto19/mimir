In a prologue a character called Ermyntrude says that though she is the widow of a millionaire, she is now poor, living on a small income from her father, the Archdeacon, who has told her to take a job as a lady's maid so that she can meet another millionaire and marry back into money.
In a hotel sitting room the Princess is met by the hotel manager.
Ermyntrude, now dressed very plainly gets the job as her lady's maid.
Captain Duval, a messenger from the "Inca of Perusalem" appears with news that Inca wants one of his sons to marry the Princess.
Ermyntrude realises that the messenger is in fact the Inca in disguise.
She offers to return the trick, by pretending to be the Princess to find out what his intentions are.
The Princess, who is very timid, agrees to let Ermyntrude take charge.
Ermyntrude receives the "captain" with an air of great superiority.
She is given a gift of a jewel, designed by the Inca, but she is horrified by its size.
The Inca is impressed by the "Princess"'s grand manner and reveals his true identity.
However, he says that he recognises Ermyntrude.
He knows she is the Archdeacon's daughter, not the Princess.
But she is so convincing as a princess that now he wishes to marry her himself.
Unfortunately he already has a wife, so he suggests they should to convert to Islam so he can legally have another one.
Ermyntrude says the Inca is far too poor for her, since his country is going bankrupt because of its foolish war.
The Inca says that the war will result in his overthrow and the creation of a republic, but this will not be a problem as he will be elected as "super-president" of the republic.
He then says how surprised he is by the popularity of the war in his homeland.
He used to rely for popularity on his contributions to art, literature and science, but he was ignored.
Now the mass killing in the war leads to cheering crowds.
Despite being turned down for marriage, the Inca offers to take Ermyntrude on a drive round the town.
She accepts, but emphasises that she will "refuse any incorrect proposals" he makes to her.
