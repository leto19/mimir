Proposed answer categories:

1) People (PER): *Tom Sawyer*, *her daughter*
2) Organizations (ORG): *House Harkonnen* *The Illuminati*
3) Locations (LOC): *the forest*, *London* - merge LOC and GPE (Geo-political entities)
4) Personal descriptions (DES): *An astute wizard* *Arthur's mentor*
5) Other (OTH): *in 1942*, *because his shoes were stolen*, *he escapes from prison*

[1] Full litbank list:
